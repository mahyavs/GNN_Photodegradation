# GNN for Degradation Rate Constant Prediction

This project uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), including Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and a combination of both, to predict the photodegradation rate constant (mlogk) of water contaminants on the TiOâ‚‚ photocatalyst. The models are trained on combined experimental and molecular graph features.
